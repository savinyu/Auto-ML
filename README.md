# Automated Hyperparameter Optimization System This project provides an Automated Hyperparameter Optimization System using AutoML techniques to efficiently identify the best hyperparameter configuration for a given machine learning model and dataset.
Users can choose between Random Search and Bayesian Optimization methods for hyperparameter optimization. 
## Features - 
**Integration with Various Models**: Easily integrates with different machine learning models and handles various data types. 
**Efficient Optimization Techniques**: Employs Random Search and Bayesian Optimization (using Gaussian Processes) for hyperparameter optimization. - 
**Cross-Validation**: 
Utilizes cross-validation to evaluate model performance.  
**ROC AUC Scoring**: 
Uses ROC AUC as the evaluation metric. 
**Learning Curve Comparison**: 
Plots learning curves to compare optimization methods.
## Requirements Make sure you have the following libraries installed: 
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
You can install these libraries using pip:
